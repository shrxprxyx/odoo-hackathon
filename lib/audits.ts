 * all assets in a department"): the Asset model has no direct departmentId,
 * so a DEPARTMENT-scoped cycle matches assets whose `location` field
 * contains the department's name (e.g. "Engineering Floor 2" -> Engineering).
 * This also lines up with the wireframe's "Expected Location" column on
 * Screen 8. LOCATION scope isn't wired up for this build — treat it as ALL.
